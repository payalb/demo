Manage images 
 
docker image pull <image name> (Chapter 4): download an image from DockerHub 
 
docker image ls Chapter 5 (Chapter 5): list all local images 
 
docker image build -t <image name> .  (Chapter 6): build an image with a tag (note the dot!) 
 
docker image push <image name>  (Chapter 9): publish an image to dockerhub 
 
docker image tag <image id> <tag name>  (Chapter 9): tag an image - either alias an exisiting image or apply a :tag to one 
 
 
Manage Containers  
 
docker container run -p <public port>:<container port> <image name>  (Chapter 4): run a container from an image, publishing the specified ports 
 
docker container ls -a (Chapter 4): list all containers, even the stopped ones 
 
docker container stop <container id>  (Chapter 4) stop a running container 
 
docker container start <container id>  (Chapter 4) restart a stopped container 
 
docker container rm <container id>  (Chapter 4) remove a stopped container 

 Docker for Java Developers - Quick Command Reference 2 
 
Manage Containers  (ctd) 
 
docker container prune (Chapter 4) remove all stopped containers 
 
docker container run -it  <image name>  (Chapter 5): run a container with interactive terminal 
 
docker container run -d  <image name> (Chapter 5): run a container detached (or in a daemon like way) 
 
docker container exec -it <container id> <command> (Chapter 5): run a command in a container 
 
docker container exec -it <container id> bash (Chapter 5): special form of the above, runs a bash shell, connected to your local terminal (your distro needs to have bash, alpine will require /bin/sh) 
 
docker container logs -f <container id>  (Chapter 5) Follow the log (STDIN/System.out) of the container 
 
docker container commit -a "author" <container id> <image name> (Chapter 6) Take a snapshot image of a container 
 
Manage your (local) Virtual Machine 
 
docker-machine ip  (Chapter 4): Find the IP address of your VirtualMachine, required for Docker Toolbox users only

Manage Networks 
 
docker network ls (Chapter 10): list all networks docker network create <network name> (Chapter 10): create a network using the bridge driver 
 
Manage Volumes 
 
docker volume ls (Chapter 11): list all volumes docker volume prune (Chapter 11): delete all volumes that are not currently mounted to a container docker volume inspect <volume name> (Chapter 11): inspect a volume (can find out the mount point, the location of the volume on the host system) docker volume rm <volume name> (Chapter 11): remove a volume 
 
Docker Compose 
 
docker-compose up (Chapter 13): process the default docker-compose.yaml file, starting any containers as required. If containers are already running they are ignored, meaning this command also serves as a "redeploy". docker-compose up -d (Chapter 13): run containers in the detached state. Note the order of the command line arguments! docker-compose logs -f <service name> (Chapter 13): follow the log for the specified service. Omit the -f to tail the log. docker-compose down (Chapter 13): stop all the containers (services) listed in the default compose file.

Manage a Swarm 
 
docker swarm init (--advertise-addr <ip address>) (Chapter 14): Switch the machine into Swarm mode. We didn't cover how to stop swarm mode: docker swarm leave --force  docker service create <args> (Chapter 14): Start a service in the swarm. The args are largely the same as those you will have used in docker container run. docker network create --driver overlay <name> (Chapter 14): Create a network suitable for using in a swarm. docker service ls  (Chapter 14): List all services docker node ls  (Chapter 14): List all nodes in the swarm docker service logs -f <service name> (Chapter 14): Follow the log for the service. This feature is a new feature in Docker and may not be available on your version (especially if using Linux Repository Packages). docker service ps <service name> (Chapter 15): List full details of the service - in particular the node on which it is running and any previous failed containers from the service. docker swarm join-token <worker|manager> (Chapter 16): Get a join token to enable a new node to connect to the swarm, either as a worker or manager. 
 
Manage Stacks 
 
docker stack ls (Chapter 15): list all stacks on this swarm. docker stack deploy -c <compose file> <stack name> (Chapter 15): deploy (or re-deploy) a stack based on a standard compose file. docker stack rm <stack name> (Chapter 15): delete a stack and its corresponding services/networks/etc.
